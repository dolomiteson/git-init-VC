      <p>I am a Software Developer Engineer in Test.<br> 
        I joined this class to upgrade my knowledge with<br> 
        the current resources for Web Development. I hope<br>
        to use this class to move from Quality Assurance to<br> 
        a full-time Software Developer.
      </p>
      <p>For my personal life: I am married, have two children,<br> 
        and a dog. I enjoy cooking, tv, and gaming. I used to<br> 
        be a homebrewer. Which I intend to get back into once<br>
        my schooling is over and I am back to a normal quality<br> 
        of life.
